    <h1> READING<h2>
        <p1> Reading No.1 </p1>
        <p1> Q1: What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?
A good definition would be a series of interconnectivity as parts of a mechanism. Something that does not work in this topic, in my opinion,  would be an organized scheme of method.</br> 
Q2: For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case. 
Modularity: individual component details ( lincoln logs ). 
Decomposability: breaking down of all things organic ( throwing a banana in soil than in the garbage ) .
Emergence: growth, gradual incline / new interactions that build up into something big. (someone’s height piles of dirt) 
Chaos Theory: random but organized, ( slinky toys)<br> 
Q3: Give us your definition of what Tessellation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading.
Tessellation is a variety of shapes that create patterns using tiling techniques. I have seen examples of these Tessellations when learning about commissioned palaces in Turkey and the middle east to worship their beliefs.<br>
Q4: What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tessellation? What are the properties that are in opposition with each other? 
I feel Modularity is more organized and put together than Tessellations are. Modularities are attentive to details and have a rhythm and Tessellations are interpreted uniformed as well but I feel the key difference between these two is one is meant to be ornate and the other doesn't.<br> 
Q5: What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic) 
Complexity is irregular, it doesn't have any periodic repetition as for something that is uniform that element’s are recurring. </p1>
