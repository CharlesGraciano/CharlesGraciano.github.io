Q1. What are the differences between site specific art work and the idea of art interventions.</br>
</br>
</br>

- art  that is made for specific location means there is an attachment. The idea to be able to announce locations for their reputation or what they are known for is very unique because it allows the artist to become a manipulator and that I feel is promanate in the key differences of site specifc work and interventions.
</br></br>



Q2. What are the similarities and differences regarding the work of Walter De Maria and Banksy? include your thoughts of on their idea of site specificness and interventions</br></br></br>

- Walter's work is very open ended and in a confined space. it loooks to be more formal but out of the ordinary. What's unique about it is the fact that something involving the nature is confined in a very populated metro city. Bansky creates his art in street art and allowing his art to speak for the actions for what wordds can't say in public. His work is very strong and I feel Bansky's work is a little stronger to announce his signs because of the value it has and the messages he announces.</br> </br>



Q3. What are some of the most common creative tactics that all the 'signs' must shares? What must sign have to remain relevant? We are talking about signs that both in the practical context as well as signs that function as art.</br></br></br>

- These signs works because the are attracting attention from the appropiate audiance. Yes, Signs must be relevent in order for them to be interpretted because it will make sense for the viewers in public. It will get the attention it deserves because of the relations and familairity promotes. </br></br>



Q4. What Kind of art, not shown here, have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description, provide images if possible.</br></br></br>

- One particular example i can think of is seeing memorial graves on the side of freeways or streets. I feel these are unfortunate but a good exapmple of what a site specific sign is because of the the assumption of the actions that took place.
