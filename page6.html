 <h1>Assignment 4 : Signs </h1>
        <h2> mock ups: these signs are to be placed in thier apropriate locations where the sign makes sense. I decided to work with something playful and something
	      to hopefully bring a little light to whats going on in our world. My idea is to have the viewer smile when they se these signs and also read the as functional works. </h2>

        <h2>3D Renders</h2>
	      
	      <p>These renders demonstrate where these signs actually take place in our real world. I dfelrt these environments are best appropriated with these concepts.  </p>
