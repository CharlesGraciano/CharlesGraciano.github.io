    <p> As an artist, there are limitless ways to express our creativity.<br>
      Digital media  art can be contemporary or modern but the advancement in technology and art will only get better as time continues.<br>
      I'm Charles Graciano and I'm an artist of Digital Media and Motion Graphics. </p>
    <p> Motion graphics fascinate me the most when digital media is involved.<br>
       While studying in San Francisco, I learned a lot about the involvement with media graphics.<br>
      I worked along side with professionals to create traditional animation, storyboard, code, and video art.<br>
      throughout my time there I gained an interest to exapnd my creativity and drive to fullfil the culture of digital media art. <br>
       Motion graphics is what Disney does with their animation films and earlier motion graphics was very experimental and someone I highly look up to.<br>
      It is interesting that the effects these early pioneers, such as Walt Disney, would experiment with would actually have an influence to todayâ€™s movie producers, directors, and artists like myself.
