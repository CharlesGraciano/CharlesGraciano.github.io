      <p1> Limited animation done in graphite and animation paper. This is my first animation I have done when I studied animation at the Art Institute in San Francisco. It was an extraordinary experience learning from instructors who created, produced and assisted with animation and shows as a child. Walt Disney inspired me become an animator and story teller. Through the path of his success and loyalty Walt Disney showed me to never give up and dreams come true with hard work and dedication.</p1>

      <p1>As an artist, I am curious. I am not afraid to think outside the of box and often find myself overwhelmed with creative ideas and concepts. Pandora's Box: Deming's Journey, combines multiple mediums through waves of sound and bouncing colors with images. Creating this edit showcases my talent as an artist and passion for my craft.</p1>

      <p1>My name is Charles Graciano and I am a first generation Mexican American in the Bay Area. Guanajuato is a city of beauty and love, and where my Mother originated. Her passion towards success and fulfillment inspired me to become an artist and create beyond my wildest imaginations. With my passion of art and love from my family and culture; I show you, Guanajuato: City of Beauty.</p1>
      
      <h1> WEEK 2 <h2>
        <p1> Reading No.1 </p1>
        <p1> Q1: What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?
A good definition would be a series of interconnectivity as parts of a mechanism. Something that does not work in this topic, in my opinion,  would be an organized scheme of method.</br> 
Q2: For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case. 
Modularity: individual component details ( lincoln logs ). 
Decomposability: breaking down of all things organic ( throwing a banana in soil than in the garbage ) .
Emergence: growth, gradual incline / new interactions that build up into something big. (someone’s height piles of dirt) 
Chaos Theory: random but organized, ( slinky toys)<br> 
Q3: Give us your definition of what Tessellation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading.
Tessellation is a variety of shapes that create patterns using tiling techniques. I have seen examples of these Tessellations when learning about commissioned palaces in Turkey and the middle east to worship their beliefs.<br>
Q4: What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tessellation? What are the properties that are in opposition with each other? 
I feel Modularity is more organized and put together than Tessellations are. Modularities are attentive to details and have a rhythm and Tessellations are interpreted uniformed as well but I feel the key difference between these two is one is meant to be ornate and the other doesn't.<br> 
Q5: What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic) 
Complexity is irregular, it doesn't have any periodic repetition as for something that is uniform that element’s are recurring. </p1>

        <h1>-----------------------DMANIACS-GROUP-PROJECT----------------------</h1>
        <h1>FASTENERS</h1>
        <p> the idea behind this idea is to create a Fastener using paper amterial or anything that can be best suited for you. I choice Cardboard since this was the only materail around the house I had a lot of. The Box I chose to craete my Fastener had subtractive and additive indents which made my idea come together smoothly.
