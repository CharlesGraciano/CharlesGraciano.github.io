    	<h1>ARTifact</h1>

<h1>In a world far away lived a demon named hulu
	who led can you or comments or questions thousands by the power of his talent. He was a good demon who brought talent and creativity together but was destroyed by his brothers and sisters who didnâ€™t see or understand his power. This led them to spread his body around the entire world so that the all talented and Hulu will not find his pieces and bring himself back together for revenge. Currently, his tooth has mysteriously placed itself in an abandoned chest, seeking its bearer of extraordinary talent to revive the long forgotten Hulu.

<p>For this product I decided to make a 3-D printable guitar pick. The pic is thick and a lot larger than a traditional guitar pick which gives the player the ability to hold the pic in their palm increasing players comfortability and advantage of never dropping their pick while playing again. The pic is oddly shaped, like a tooth. This gives your thumb a comfortable position to hold the pic along with your palm feeling a handle to hold on to the pic while playing. I decided to break up my demonstration in two parts. Part one being in the narrative describing the artifact as a token of extraordinary talent by a demon named Hulu. The second part Showcases the pic and a close-up angle. As you can see the player who is using the pic is using the pic at a natural angle also leaving your wrist and strained after hours of playing.

<h4>Behind The Scenes</h4>
	<h3> The making of the Hulu Tooth</h3>
	<p> The tooth was made in Fusion 360. I was inspired by Shark teeth and other prehistoric fossils so I wanted to capture something that fit those two interests.
		Once the tooth was designed to my liking, I decided to document an actual version of this model because I wanted to play guiat with it. ALthough it is shaped like a tooth and looks nothing like a traditional guitar pick, I wanted to give it a shot.
		The final product was a lot larger than a normal guitar pick; the thickness is prominate. The model was printed in a clear arcylic but weathered with black ink, glow in the dark elmers glue and a lot of sanding.
